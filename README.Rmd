> *fit and compare **Species-Area Relationship (SAR)** models using multi-model inference*

**sars** provides functionality to fit twenty SAR model using non-linear regression, and to calculate multi-model averaged curves using various information criteria. The software also provides easy to use functionality to plot multi-model SAR curves and to generate confidence intervals using bootstrapping. Additional SAR related functions
include fitting the linear version of the power model and comparing parameters with the non-linear version, fitting
the general dynamic model of island biogeography, fitting the random placement model to a species abundance -
site matrix, and extrapolating fitted SAR models to predict richness on larger islands / sample areas.

As this is version 1.2.1 of the package, it is possible that there are some bugs in places. Please report any
issues to us via GitHub.

The package has an associated vignette that provides examples of how to use the package.

A website for the package can be found here: https://txm676.github.io/sars/

Version 1.1.1 of the package has been archived on the Zenodo research data repository (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.2573067).

## Installation

You can install the released version of sars from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sars")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("txm676/sars")
```
## Example usage

Basic usage of **sars** will result in using two types of functions:

```{r include = FALSE}
library(sars)
```

To fit the power sar model [@Arrhenius1921] to the 'galapagos' [@Preston1962] data set:
```{r}
fit_pow <- sar_power(data = galap)
```

Attempting to fit all 20 sar models to the 'galapagos' [@Preston1962] data set and get a multi-model SAR:
```{r warning = FALSE}
mm_galap <- sar_average(data = galap)
```

Each of the 'fitted' objects have corresponding plot methods:

to fit the logarithmic SAR model [@Gleason1922] to the 'galapagos' data set and plot it
```{r}
fit_loga <- sar_loga(data = galap)

plot(fit_loga)
```

to fit a multimodel SAR curve to the 'galapagos' data set and plot it
```{r}
mm_galap <- suppressMessages(sar_average(data = galap, verb = FALSE))

plot(mm_galap, pLeg = FALSE)
```
